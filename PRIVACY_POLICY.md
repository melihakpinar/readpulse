## Information We Collect

**readpulse** does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data. The extension operates locally on your browser and does not transmit any data to external servers or third parties.

## Permissions

These permissions are solely used to support the extensionâ€™s functionality and are not used to collect or share user data.

## Data Storage and Security

All settings (e.g., reading speed) are stored locally on the user's device using Chrome's `storage` API. This data is never transferred to external servers or shared with any third parties.
